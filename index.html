    <p>WEB is a computer programming system created
    by Donald E. Knuth as the first implementation of wh
    at he called "literate programming": the idea that one could creat
    e software as works of literature, by embedding source code inside
    descriptive text, rather than the reverse (as is common practice in mo
    st programming languages), in an order that is convenient for exposition t
    o human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.
    WEB consists of two secondary progra
    ms: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code fro
    m the source texts, and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted, pr
    intable documentation using TeX.
    CWEB is a version of WEB for the C programming language, while
    noweb is a separate literate programming tool, which is inspired by W
    EB (as reflected in the name) and which is language agnostic.
    The most significant programs written in WEB are TeX and Metafont. Mod
    ern TeX distributions use another program Web2C to convert WEB source to C.
